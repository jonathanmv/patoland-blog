## A simple idea

[patoland](https://patoland.com) started with a simple idea: make a drawing come to life. With the power of technology, patoland can take a kid's drawing and turn it into a digital asset than can wear clothes or move between rooms.

The first step was giving kids a template to paint a _pato_ (duck in spanish). The template included clothes also to be painted and combined. Honestly, I thought kids would love to create different styles. I thought they would share their creations with other kids and improve on top of other kids' designs. In reality, they painted one pato if they painted at all.

It's not that I expected kids to think like me (or maybe? ðŸ¤”) but I was a bit dissapointed. Trying to get in the shoes of my final user I asked my niece: what do kids want to do with the patos? Her answer was a lesson on life perspectives.

## Changing my perspective

After taking a picture, patoland removes the background to get a transparent image with the pato in the center. That allows patoland to _change the background_ of pato. I thought of adding some colorful, animated backgrounds and told that to my niece. After a few seconds of reflection, she said:

> Oooh! so I can take the pato to the park, or to the pool, or to the beach.

My perspective was that the pato stays and the background changes. The background for me was just whatever is behind the pato. Its only function was to make the pato look better. Her perspective was different. To start, the pato is the one moving. She _takes_ the pato here and there, and based on where she is taking the pato, she uses some clothes or others. Then, the background is not an abstract concept for her. A color background, say green, doesn't mean anything to her. It needs to be an scenario where a pato can be, where it makes sense for it to be. It needs to be a space: a park, a pool, the beach, etc.

And just like that, the concept of room/scenario/space was born in patoland. I'm working now on giving tools to the kids to create rooms where their patos can be.
